## TEDxSanJosedeMayo website

#### Q:Why ?  A:Why not?
 - I was getting involved on web development when I saw an advertisment of a TEDx conference at my hometown, 
so I started to design a simple landing page for the event. 
Then I hosted it on gh-pages and send an e-mail to the organizers, I asked them if they'd like to use it, they said yes and after a meeting I joint them as a Team Member of the event ðŸ¤©


#### Disclamer:
  - Well I'm  not really proud of the code quality in this repo, but here is where I started, 
hopefully soon I will get some time to refactor it ðŸ˜…
